# Udacity Welcome to the NanoDegree Program Review
**Format:** I didn't initially count this as a class, as it was pretty short and looked more like an orientation for the Data Analysis NanoDegree (DAND). I did end up tracking it here as a class, because it does have a class project requirement. The Data Analysis program used to be larger, broken into two specific terms. A couple years ago, the DAND program was instead finetuned to be a single term focusing more on the data analysis, and the Programming for Data Science with Python NanoDegree (PDSND) took some of the classes that were removed from the DAND program. This set up the PDSND program as a recommend pre-requisite, and this "Welcome to the DAND" class appears to be a sort of "You must be this tall to ride" gate for the program, as it really focuses on demonstrating basic skills from this program, without doing much in the way of teaching new skills. 
**Prior Experience With Subject:** This is the first class in the Data Analysis NanoDegree, which I began after I completed the recommended Programming for Data Science with Python NanoDegree. This class appears to be largely functioning as a knowledge check for the skills from the PDSND program, before you jump into the deeper end with the DAND program. As I had just completed the PDSND program, I was definitely prepared for this class decently.
