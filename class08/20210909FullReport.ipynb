    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project requires the student to put together three datasets relating to the [@WeRateDogs twitter account](https://twitter.com/dog_rates/). An initial .csv is provided with an archive of tweets for this account, and students must programmatically download a .tsv file with dog breed projects. Students also use the `json` and `tweepy` packages in Python to pull data regarding the archived tweets from the Twitter API. With these three tables of data, students then must wrangle the data, put it together, and then analyze that data to come up with at least three insights and one visualization of their choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "While many questions could be asked of this data, the three that I decided to focus on for this analysis were:\n",
    "- Do puppies or full grown dogs get higher ratings, on average?\n",
    "- Do puppies or full grown dogs tend to get greater engagement on Twitter?\n",
    "- What is the relationship between engagement with a tweet (retweets, favorites) and the rating issued to a dog?\n",
    "\n",
    "There were many errors or problems within the dataset, because it is intended as a showcase for students to perform data wrangling operations. My fixes were primarily geared towards facilitating exploratory data analysis and then towards refining the quality of the data to allow me to examine these three questions. \n",

    "## Gathering Data\n",
    "Data is gathered on the @WeRateDogs Twitter account in three ways. First, a .csv file is provided for download within the browser, containing a variety of tweet data. Second, a .tsv file is provided for download, with the requirement it be downloaded programmatically. This file contains data about predictions of each dog's breed made from Udacity's Machine Learning program. Third, the student is to use the `json` and `tweepy` packages to gather data from the Twitter API to get extra information about the tweets provided in the .csv file, including number of retweets and favorites, at a minimum.

About 10 minutes later, while I was reading through `tweepy` documentation to try to understand how to use it, I received notice that my application was suspended from accessing the Twitter API, before I'd even had a chance to use it.

With this particular dataset and the nature of tweets (some are standalone, some are replies, some have images, etc.) a lot of the visual exploration had to be done by viewing the actual tweets from @WeRateDogs. I'm going to start with `df_tweets`, the biggest dataframe in the project. I am required to identify and fix two issues of data tidyness and eight issues of data quality in the entire dataset.

That's sensible, because retweets are not actually \"new\" content or data and are essentially \"duplicates\". A retweet functions similar to a \"share\" on Facebook, where an individual is simply repeating or signal-amplifying something that someone else said. This means it is not a new post (or \"tweet\") but instead a re-post (a \"re-tweet\"). I did check a few of the retweets from @WeRateDogs in browser, and they were very commonly just retweeting prior \"highlights\" of theirs. Inclusion of this data would definitely amount to counting it twice, so this is a good choice to get rid of. I'm going to choose to get rid of this data now, as well as the associated columns. Only the rows which are retweets have any data in these columns, and all other columns (\"original\" tweets) are populated with `NaN` in these columns. "

    "This is a complicated issue, and I'm going to tackle it first before other tasks. A \"reply\" tweet is one which is made in response to another tweet, and 2+ tweets constitute a \"thread\" of conversation. A reply may be issued in response to another user, or to one's own tweets. In this case, I can look at a tweet by using it's `extended_url` (clickable, if called) or pasting the `tweet_id` into my browser, prefixed with 'https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/'. In doing some visual exploration of different types of replies, I found a few types of replies:\n",

    "- Reply to self to amend/affirm a prior rating ([Example](https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/671550332464455680))\n",
    "An amended rating is certainly one that we want to keep. In fact, it presents another problem - we actually will want to get rid of the preceding tweet, if its in our dataset, as the prior grade is now rendered inaccurate by additional details, facts, or deliberation. \n",
    "- Reply to self to issue new ratings for other dogs ([Example](https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/802265048156610565))\n",
    "This is fairly uncommon, as each dog rating is usually placed into its own thread. However, when this happens, it does create a situation where new ratings may not necessarily supercede previous ratings in a thread. \n",
    "- Reply to others requesting a rating ([Example](https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/863427515083354112))\n",
    "This is a fresh and original rating that we would want to keep in our dataset. It is easily distinguished as being done in response to another user_id, rather than to @WeRateDogs' self. \n",
    "\n",
    "We do have the information available to determine if a reply-tweet was made to another party or to @WeRateDogs' self, but that information isn't usable right now because of how the data is stored in floats in scientific notation. Being unable to proceed with this problem until this is addressed, I'll prioritize this before continuing my exploration. \n",

    "This shows a total of 47 replies to self, of 78 replies total. I verified that the user_id '4196983835' was @WeRateDogs by replacing 'https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/671550332464455680' with 'https://twitter.com/4196983835/status/671550332464455680' and opening this link in a new browser tab, and it worked without issue, automatically filling in the user_id with the user's Twitter handle. Sorting through several of the 31 replies to other users, these seemed to be of the \"please rate my dog\" variety, resulting in new ratings which should remain a part of the dataset. Of the remaining 47 replies to self, I took a sample of 10 of them to look into and see what they were consisting of."

    "Continuing my assessment of the data, I looked into the final four columns of `df_tweets`: `doggo`, `floofer`, `pupper`, and `puppo`.

We can already see that many of these are incorrectly stored as 'None' rather than `NaN`, which is an important distinction - the absence of a value is not the same as saying \"Not a doggo\".

    "Dogs are generally rated on out of 10 (the denominator), but the numerator is frequently over 10 because doggos are just such heckin' good bois. While that is a feature of this platform, these are almost exclusively a 10, 11, 12, or 13. 14's are extremely rare, with [the first 14/10 given to a dog who saved another dog's life](https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/685681090388975616)! As a result, I was skeptical of some of these extremely high values for both numerator and denominator. Fortunately, it is not a large number of dog ratings coming in over a 15, so I decided to go through them all and make some observations."

It seems fair to chalk this up as an extreme outlier in an unbridled fit of patriotism in the more promising before-times. This would seem to be supported by the statement in [this post](https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/838085839343206401) from near the chronological end of this dataset, stating that a 15/10 has not yet been found. While I could delete this rating, this seems unfair to an indisputably good boi, so I'm going to instead amend the rating from 1776 to 14, the maximum left in the current dataset. In this way, Atticus can be represented without breaking the comparison to other dogs. \n",

Where we've had many numeric values needing to be stored as strings, in this case, these counts should be integers, so this will need to be addressed. It will be necessary to cast 'tweet_id' as a string, so that these strings can be joined to the matching strings in `df_tweets`. We can also see from `describe()` that the values in the retweet & favorite columns do make sense and there don't appear to be any issues with that data. The data in df_json should be joined to the tweet-level data/metrics recorded in `df_tweets`, as this information is just as much a part of the tweet as any of the data there. Also, something which will be useful for the analysis portion of this study is to generate a \"total engagement\" column, which retweets and favorites are both examples of. \n",

    "The `df_preds` table requires a bit of explanation. The 'p1...', 'p2...', and p3...' columns measure columns are the three predictions from machine learning software of what this dog is. This prediction is generally an attempt to identify a dog's breed, but it seems to have misidentified dogs as other objects - 'dogsled', 'hyena', 'meerkat', 'tub', and 'hippopotamus' are all non-dog results that have been predicted based upon a dog's pictures. The prediction is then followed by a coefficient indicating the confidence of the program in that guess of \"breed\", and then a Boolean follows indicating whether that prediction was actually a dog. This is an important distinction, as this is not evaluating whether or not the guess was correct or not, but merely if that guess was a dog. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of noticeable issues here, the 'tweet_id' column is again incorrectly cast and will have to be modified to a string from an integer, as was done previously. Running through several samples from this data, I don't see any issues in any of the prediction data, and the numeric data presented by `describe()` doesn't highlight any obvious problems either. Where a concern potentially does exist is in the interaction between 'img_num' (number of images attached to the post, up to 4 at maximum) and 'jpg_url'. For observations with more than 1 picture attached to the tweet, the 'jpg_url' appears to only have the link for the final image. This is not a problem for tweets with only 1 image, but those tweets with more than 1 image are missing links to the images preding the last image. This is 295 tweets total that are effected, though some of these may be excluded upon joining with the `df_tweets` table if the associated tweet is a retweet or other tweet that is being deleted from the dataset. This may present an issue for anyone using this dataset for machine learning models, but that is not the point of this analysis, so it will not be addressed here. \n",

Those two datasets certainly complement each other, as each contains details directly relevant to the tweets from @WeRateDogs - IDs and URLs for the tweets themselves, the content of the tweet (ratings, text, etc.), and information about engagement with that tweet (retweets, favorites). Machine learning predictions are not specifically relevant to the tweets themselves and constitute separate observations stemming from the content of those tweets. As such, this would be inappropriate to include in the other joined data. \n",

It appears that some dogs got two stages, such as this example with 'doggopuppo', where dogs received both 'doggo' and 'puppo' stages. Looking at the text here, it appears that both the words 'doggo' and 'puppo' were used, so both were scraped. The text here clearly indicates that this is a 'puppo', and looking at the tweet and the associated image, we can clearly see that 'puppo' is consistent with this labrador's smol stature and puppo-like comportment. This row should be updated to reflect that this is a puppo, but I'll have to continue looking at the other problems in this column."

While we data is not available for most of the dogs in the dataset, those which are identified as 'puppers' or 'puppos' could be assumed to be puppies, and those identified as 'floofers' or 'doggos' could be assumed to be adult dogs. Scores could be compared for each group, which could indicate if either group gets higher scores, and if so, which group. I'm expecting to see that puppies have higher scores, because puppers are super cute, and cuteness is something that tends to drive social media engagement. "

    "This shows that while puppos have many more ratings than doggos, on average, dog ratings are actually higher. Puppers seem to have a higher variance in their ratings, especially at the low end. The lower number of 14's could be explained by the fact that pups are less capable of doing heroic things than older, mature, trained dogs, which is something that will earn 14's. This is evident with the first two 14's to be given out, the first to a dog who saved another dog's life and the second to a dog who searched for survivors at the wreckage of the World Trade Center. Pups lack vocational training and instead try to skate by on their youthful good looks, something that is undeniably adorable but fleeting in the long run. If puppers want to raise their overall perception on the internet, they clearly need to start working harder. "

    "**Do puppies or full grown dogs tend to get greater engagement?** <br>\n",
    "I was also curious if puppies or grown dogs would get higher engagement on Twitter, in the form of retweets and favorites. Again, while data is not available for all dogs in the dataset, those identified as 'puppers' or 'puppos' can be assumed to be puppies, and those identified as 'floofers' or 'doggos' can be assumed to be grown dogs. Total engagement (retweets + favorites) could be compared for each group, to determine if one group or the other gets higher engagement. My suspicion was that this would generally track with ratings, but I also suspected that puppies would have higher ratings and was surprised that this was not the case. Given that dogs had the higher ratings on average, I'm suspecting that they'll also have higher engagement too."

    "We can see that the dogs have a considerably larger engagement on Twitter than pups. Whether looking at the mean or the median as a measure of center, we can see that dogs get twice as much engagement in terms of retweets and favorites. While I did expect dogs to have higher engagement based on finding that they have higher ratings, I was not expecting the difference to be this significant. "

    "By graphing a scatter plot of the 'total_engagement' metric (retweets + favorites received by a tweet) against the rating issued to a dog in that tweet, we can see the relationship between a dog's rating and engagement by other users on Twitter. As higher ratings reflect funnier or cuter dogs, I would expect to a see a positive linear relationship here, as people engage more with things that are particularly cute or funny. Note that at this point, I'm not looking strictly at \"grown dogs\" as in the prior two questions, but at all dogs in the @WeRateDogs dataset. "

    "In the graph above, we can definitely see an effect where higher ratings get higher engagement. This effect is not as strong as I would've suspected though, with a correlation of only 0.37, a moderately positive linear relationship. One thing I had considered was that engagement might not be linear and might instead be parabolic in nature, with an increase at low ratings because low ratings might consist of \"roasting\" or \"dunking on\" a dog (or more likely, the dog's owner). Given the nature of how Twitter (and social media in general) loves to pile on people, this could also drive engagement on low scores. Given the small sample size at the low end of the ratings, this could be problematic as a conclusion, but we do see a slight uptick at the 0 and 1 ratings that indicates such a relationship may exist."

    "Placing \"Best Fit\" lines on the scatter plot for a linear relationship, a quadratic relationship, and a cubic one, its clear that the quadratic and cubic fits are more accurate than the basic linear fit. The cubic fit appears to be closer than the quadratic at the high end (ratings of 14 in particular), but the quadratic fit is much closer than the cubic at the low end (ratings of 0, maybe at 1 as well). This might lead to a conclusion that the quadratic line has an overall better fit here, but the small amount of data at the low end would mitigate the higher performance. As a result, I would say the cubic fit is probably the most accurate, and that the relationship between dog rating and tweet engagement is non-linear. \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in my analysis, I'm somewhat surprised that puppies do not get higher ratings and engagement than dogs. In my experience, \"cute\" and \"funny\" both drive engagement on social media, perhaps only behind \"anger\" and \"outrage\". I tend to find puppies cuter and often funnier than dogs, so I expected to see that borne out by both their ratings and their engagement on social media. This ended up not being the case, and as mentioned, there may be some reasons for this. At least by @WeRateDogs' criteria for issuing ratings, the highest ratings tend to require acts by the dog in question that elevate beyond cuteness, which puppies are simply going to be less equipped for. While that may explain why puppies tend not to get the absolute highest ratings, it does not account for why their ratings are also more spread out among the low ratings (below 10). There are 421 ratings below 10 within the master dataset, 39 of which are puppies, and it would be necessary to dig through these manually to start trying to find patterns that would explain this variance at the low end of the scale for pups relative to grown dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the trends between engagement and dog ratings, I wasn't particularly surprised to see that the relationship between the two was non-linear. There is a truism that [\"Each day on Twitter, there is one main character. The goal is to never be it.\"](https://twitter.com/maplecocaine/status/1080665226410889217) which refers to the fact that there is generally either someone being absolutely loved or being absolutely hated each day on social media, with really no in between. When looking at a scale of ratings, this obviously relates to how the extreme ends of the scale (low *or* high) are more interesting or evoking a stronger reaction than the mushy middle of things which are merely \"fine\". What was more interesting about this was that the cubic best fit line seemed to approximate the real data better than the quadratic one. I had expected that if a non-linear relationship existed, it would've been parabolic in nature, with peaks at the extremes of the scale. This would seem to indicate a local peak in the low-middle part of the rating scale (around 4, on the graph above) and a lack of engagement with ratings further below that. Why this would be, I'm unable to explain without further analysis, but it must be acknowledged that the low end of the scale suffers from small sample size. A larger sample size might lead to more insight here, and it might lead to the quadratic best fit line becoming the better approximation of the whole. "
