# Udacity Data Analysis NanoDegree Portfolio

## Description

This is a repository of my work in summer 2021 earning the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND). I only began learning programming with Python in Jan 2021 and had no experience with SQL, so I started with the recommended "beginner" program, Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python NanoDegree (PDSND). After earning that NanoDegree, I moved on to the more advanced DAND program. 

I intend to upload all of my projects to this Github for both prospective employers and as a potential aid for fellow students coming behind me through this program. If you're using my work to help you solve problems in these projects yourself, please be sure to acknowledge such, in compliance with Udacity's Honor Code. I've also included my reviews of each class in the PDSND -> DAND program, to hopefully inform prospective students on what they're getting into. 

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or would otherwise like to speak about my projects or my experiences with the class.
