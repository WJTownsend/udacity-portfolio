# Udacity Data Analyst NanoDegree Portfolio
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WJTownsend/udacity-portfolio/main/images/UdacityBanner.jpg">

## Description

This is a repository of my work in summer 2021 earning the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND). I only began learning programming with Python in Jan 2021 and had no experience with SQL, so I started with the recommended "beginner" program, Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python NanoDegree (PDSND). After earning that NanoDegree, I moved on to the more advanced DAND program. 

I have uploaded all of my projects to this Github for review by both prospective employers and as a potential aid for fellow students coming behind me through this program. If you're using my work to help you solve problems in these projects yourself, please be sure to acknowledge such, in compliance with Udacity's Honor Code. Each of the projects included here met assignment specifications upon review, so they should be good resources for anyone struggling on the projects. I've also included my reviews of each class in the PDSND -> DAND program, as well as the time I tracked being spent on each class, to hopefully inform prospective students on what they're getting into. Note that time spent includes both time spent on the classroom portion, and time spent on the associated project.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or would otherwise like to speak about my projects or my experiences with the class.

(NOTE (*): Class 03's project involved writing a program in Python to explore data, and Class 04's project involved putting that program on Github, along with making other improvements. Thus, Project 2 is a .py file inside of Project 3.)

## Acknowledgements

A tremendous thanks goes out to my wife, Shannon. Without her support, none of this would be possible. I'm working towards making a successful career change into data science, and she has given me the opportunity to do so. She is the true MVP.

A huge acknowledgement goes out to [@JoleneYao](https://github.com/joleneyao/udacity-DAND), whose portfolio was the inspiration for putting together a proper looking one for myself, rather than just putting up a project or two. Still being relatively new to Github, cloning and taking apart her portfolio was super useful for learning to build my own.

A super useful tool for putting this together was the [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables#) for making it easy to make this table, generating it in a GUI and then pasting the output right into the README.md. 

Another big thank you goes out to [Astral Throb](https://www.youtube.com/c/AstralThrob/videos) and [Odysseus](https://www.youtube.com/c/OdysseusOfficial/videos) on Youtube for their synthwave mixes that are perfect for having something moderately energetic but not distracting on while doing homework. For all of the time that I spent on these NanoDegree programs, I had their tunes on whenever I could.
