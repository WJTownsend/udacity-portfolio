This was in large part because our difference was lower than the mean, so it had a long way to go to get to answering our question in the affirmative. In this case, we're asking \"What's the likelihood that this difference is *significantly different* than the mean\", and our new p-value says \"It's not likely, but it's a lot more likely than it was before\".

This also quickly starts to bleed into other issues such as promotional pricing, bundles, etc. which could also drive conversions. User factors might also be a significant consideration. Some age ranges, genders, backgrounds, etc. may be more or less comfortable with purchasing online, or they may respond differently to different methods of marketing when purchasing online, or they may put different weights on the factors that go into whether a sale is made or not.*</span>\n",

CA is a bit lower compared to the UK and US, but its also a much smaller sample size than the other two countries. The statistical summary supports this observation, as the p-values for US and UK (remember, CA is the baseline) are not far enough away (under 0.05) to say that the user's country is statistically significant. The data for the US and UK is relatively similar to each other (if we do this analysis with either country as the baseline, they have much higher p-values with each other than they do CA), but CA's data is definitely further from the US & UK. I cannot say that this difference is statistically significant, but an analysis with much larger sample sizes for each country could very possibly show that conversion in CA is statistically significantly different than other countries (and perhaps between the US and UK as well).*</span>"

Again, US and UK data was more similar to each other, with CA data being further away, but this is still subject to being a relatively small portion of the overall sample. The statistical summary supports this observation, as the p-values for US and UK (CA as the baseline, again) are not far enough away (under 0.05) to indicate a statistically significant impact between the new and old pages on a per-country basis. The higher p-scores found here than in the previous analysis (checking conversion by country, regardless of old or new page) could indicate that the page delivered to a user is less impactful than the country in which they are in. However, neither the country nor the page delivered appeared to be statistically significant to a confidence interval of 95%.*</span>"

    "*Every way in which this data has been examined has failed to show a statistically significant improvement in conversion rate with the new page, relative to the old page. The new page is demonstrated to be, *at best*, statistically indistinguishable from the old in terms of conversion rate, and quite possibly less effective overall. Even accounting for different users' countries to determine if perhaps certain countries were more receptive to the new page design, this continued to be the conclusion. As a result, I must **fail to reject the null hypothesis** and recommend that the old page remain in place, in all countries.*</span>\n",
